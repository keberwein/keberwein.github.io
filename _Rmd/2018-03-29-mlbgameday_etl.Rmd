## Opening Day Is On The Way

Time to set up a presistent database to collect every pich thrown in this year's baseball season.

The `mlbgameday` package is designed to facilitate extract, transform and load for MLBAM “Gameday” data. The package is optimized for parallel processing of data that may be larger than memory.

## Install from CRAN

`install.packages("mlbgameday")`

## Quick Start

If you already have a database in-place, you can get started quickly. The `mlbgameday` package will work if your current database was gathered using the `pitchRx` package.

```{r}
library(mlbgameday)
library(RSQLite)

# Log into your database and retreive the most recent date.
con <- dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), dbname = "mlbgameday.sqlite3")

db_end <- dbGetQuery(con, "SELECT MAX(date) FROM atbat")

# Use the max date +1 as the start date and today -1 for the end date for your new payload.
get_payload(start = bd_end, end = Sys.Date() - 1, db_con = con)
```

## Extract Transform Load of MLB Advanced Media Data

## Creating a Database

```{r}
library(mlbgameday)
library(RSQLite)
library(doParallel)

# Create an empty database instance.
con <- dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), dbname = "mlbgameday.sqlite3")

# Optional: Use parallel processing to populate the database with Spring Training Games.

# Set the number of cores to use as the machine's maximum number of cores minus 1 for background processes.
no_cores <- detectCores() - 2
cl <- makeCluster(no_cores)  
registerDoParallel(cl)

get_payload(start = "2018-01-01", end = "2018-03-28", db_con = con)

# Stop and remove cluster.
stopImplicitCluster()
rm(cl)
```

## Task Scheduling
