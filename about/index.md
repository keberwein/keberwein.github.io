A data engineer, statistical programmer, and analyst specializing in medium and big data from Orlando Florida.

My favorite languages are R and Python, although I’m prone to fits of SQL and UNIX shell. I’ve authored and published several R packages and was an early adopter of using R in a production enterprise environment.

I currently work for a large cloud computing / CDN company, and deal with data of all shapes and sizes. Earlier in my career I worked as a Labor Market Analyst. I have been active in teaching and speaking about programming and visualization during my entire career.
